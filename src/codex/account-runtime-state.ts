 * cross-process credential replacement quarantine the replacement: the flag outlived the credential
 * it was evidence about, and routing then refused a perfectly good credential until a restart. A
 * post-write re-read cannot fix that — the replacement may land at any point after the write — so
 * the generation travels WITH the flag and is checked when the flag is read.
